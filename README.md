This is my repo for text files of transcriptions for https://transcription.si.edu/project/50684?status=transcription

Did this as part of my voya volunteer hours for 2024

- Quote: "Volunteer Time Away â€“ Provides paid time away to volunteer for eligible nonprofit organizations during work hours (40 hours for full-time, 20 hours for part-time)."

Volunteered in 2022-06 on the same project, but did it manually and was slow.

This time I scraped the untranscribed pages and uploaded into handwritingocr.com for automatic transcription.

Manual editing was required for conforming to the project instructions.
